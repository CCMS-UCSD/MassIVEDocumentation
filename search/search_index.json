MassIVE is a new mass spectrometry data repository designed to store, browse, redistribute, re-analyze and integrate all publicly available mass spectrometry data. Since its inception, MassIVE has imported multiple Terabytes of mass spectrometry data in over 6,000 datasets from the now-extinct Tranche repository which are now available as MassIVE datasets and can be searched using the original Tranche hash strings.

Filtering and Sorting Datasets On the datasets page, you will see a list of all current public datasets in the repository. This list is sorted by default in decreasing order of upload date (most recent first). You can page through the list using the controls at the top, and you can also sort and filter by any column using the controls in the column headers. To filter, simply enter your search term in the box at the top of the relevant column, and then click \u201cFilter\u201d; multiple filters can be combined in this manner. Alternatively, you can select specific datasets by checking the boxes next to them, then check the \u201cchecked only\u201d box, and then hit \u201cFilter\u201d, to reduce the list to only those rows that you want to see. When you are ready to view the details of a particular dataset, just click on its green \u201cMassIVE ID\u201d link to load the status page for that dataset. Viewing a Dataset Once a dataset has been successfully submitted, its status page will update to a dataset details view. This page will show the dataset\u2019s relevant metadata, as well as links to browse and download the actual dataset files themselves. This page is usually reached from a MassIVE public dataset search , although it can technically be viewed by anyone with a direct link to its URL. In fact, if a dataset is still private, then direct linking is the only way to view it, since private datasets will never show up in public searches. In this way, private datasets can still be shared with relevant users (such as publication reviewers), while still maintaining reasonable privacy from the general public. See here for more information about dataset privacy. Reviewer Access If your dataset is private, and you wish to share it with colleagues such as journal reviewers, simply provide the dataset\u2019s reviewer account login credentials. See here for more information. Dataset FTP Access See here for information on how to view or download a dataset's files via FTP. Browsing Submitted Result Files If a dataset is considered \u201ccomplete\u201c , then its result files (spectrum identifications, peptides, proteins, etc.) are provided in a standardized format that MassIVE can parse and summarize for you. To browse these results, start by clicking on the \u201cBrowse Submitted Result Files\u201d link on the dataset\u2019s status page. This will present a tabular summary of the dataset\u2019s various result files. Here you can see how many rows of each type were found in (or derived from) each submitted result file, with the numbers also serving as links to the parsed results of that type. Click on a link to view the results of the desired type, then all the usual features of ProteoSAFe tabular result views are available \u2013 filtering, sorting, showing/hiding columns, etc. For each row displaying a spectrum identification, you can click on the small spectrum image icon on the left to see an annotated visualization of it.","title":"Access Public Datasets"},{"location":"access_public_datasets/#filtering-and-sorting-datasets","text":"On the datasets page, you will see a list of all current public datasets in the repository.

There are three distinct steps in the creation of MassIVE-KB spectral libraries. Database Searching Spectra Extraction/Quality Filtering Library Creation/Augmentation Database Searching Proteomics Data for Library Creation Users can utilize a modified MSGF+ search workflow available at the Center for Computational Mass Spectrometry available here . Users may choose any public or private data they have access to and search with appropriate parameters. Synthetic Spectral Data Searching To search a synthetic peptide pool, please use this workflow . The parameters are nearly identical to MSGF+, but there are additional options. Specifically, users should add some background spectra that is not of the primary peptide pool to be identified. Users then will specify the \u201ctarget_run_filename\u201d as the full file name of the spectrum file to be identified. Identifications to other spectrum files are called decoys. Additionally, the set of peptides that that are in common between the target spectrum file and background spectrum files will be specified in \u201cblacklisted_decoy_peptides_json\u201d as a list of peptide strings in json format. Finally, users must enter the acceptable collision energies in the \u201cacceptable_collision_energies\u201d in a semicolon separated string format. All other collision energies are ignored. Spectra Extraction/Quality Filtering After the searches are finished, the identified spectra are extracted from the original mzXML/mzML files and quality filtered. A set of search jobs can be extracted at once using this workflow . To select searches to extract, select an appropriate search job from the jobs list. Any jobs run by the specific user may be selected. Creation of a New Library To create a library from an existing spectra extraction workflow, please click the \u201cCreate Library from Extracts\u201d link.

Principal Investigator Y Dataset File Selection The second section of the submission form pertains to the dataset\u2019s files. Submission File Categories MassIVE dataset files are organized into the following categories when making a submission: Required for Complete Submission Peak List Files \u2013 Processed mass spectrum files in a standardized format. The following formats are recognized by MassIVE as valid for this category: mzXML, mzML, and MGF. Result Files \u2013 Spectrum identifications in a standardized format. The following formats are recognized by MassIVE as valid for this category: mzIdentML and mzTab. Most tab-separated spectrum identification file formats can be converted to mzTab using our convenient TSV conversion workflow . Recommended for All Submissions Raw Spectrum Files \u2013 Raw mass spectrum files in a non-standard or instrument-specific format, such as Thermo .RAW files, AB Sciex .WIFF files, etc. Search Engine Files \u2013 The output of any search engine or data analysis tools or pipelines that were used to analyze this dataset, unless provided in a standardized format recognized by the \u201cResult Files\u201d category (see above). Optional License Files \u2013 Specifying how and under what conditions the dataset files may be downloaded and used. Multiple license files may be uploaded, if appropriate. By default, you can simply leave the \u201cStandard License\u201d checkbox checked and your dataset will be submitted under the default Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal license. However, if you wish to provide your own license, then you can uncheck this box and then assign your own file to the \u201cLicense Files\u201d category. Sequence Databases \u2013 Any protein or other sequence databases that were searched against in the analysis of this dataset, if applicable (usually .fasta format). Spectral Libraries \u2013 Any spectral library files that were searched against in the analysis of this dataset, or that were generated using the spectrum files provided in this dataset, if applicable. Quantification Results \u2013 Any data and metadata generated by the analysis software used for performing exclusively the quantification analysis of peptides and proteins. Gel Images \u2013 Any gel image files generated, in the event that two-dimensional gel electrophoresis has been used as a separation method. Methods and Protocols \u2013 Any open-format files containing explanations or discussions of the experimental procedures used to obtain or analyze this dataset. Supplementary Files \u2013 All remaining files belonging to this dataset that do not properly fit into any of the other listed file categories. Most of these file categories are not strictly required. The only official file requirement for a MassIVE dataset is that you must submit at least one file in either the \u201cRaw Spectrum Files\u201d or \u201cPeak List Files\u201d categories. However, if your dataset does not meet the additional requirements for a \u201c complete \u201d submission, then it will be considered only \u201cpartial\u201d. Complete vs. Partial Datasets A MassIVE dataset is considered \u201ccomplete\u201d by the standards of the ProteomeXchange consortium if and only if: The dataset includes one or more spectrum identification files in a standardized format, suitable for inclusion within the \u201cResult Files\u201d category described above. Each file submitted in the \u201cResult Files\u201d category contains at least 90% valid spectrum identifications. An identification is considered \u201cvalid\u201d if and only if it meets all of the following criteria: The identified spectrum can be found within one of the spectrum files submitted within the \u201cPeak List Files\u201d category described above. The peptide sequence and declared post-translational modifications for the identification can be found and reconstructed with no ambiguity. The MassIVE dataset submission workflow includes a file mapping interface , to ensure that submitted peak list files can be mapped to spectrum references from within the submitted result files. This is how MassIVE is able to find a spectrum in the source file, even if the result file uses a different filename to refer to that source. If a dataset does not meet the above requirements, then it will be considered \u201cpartial\u201d by ProteomeXchange. Assigning Uploaded Files to a Dataset To select files for any of the listed categories, just click on one of the \u201cSelect Input Files\u201d buttons to launch a file selector popup window (you may need to instruct your web browser to ignore popups from this site). This window will present you with a view of your MassIVE user account files, as well as an interface with which to assign these files to the various dataset categories. To add any of your uploaded files to the dataset, simply click individual files or whole folders in the left-hand folder view, and then click on the appropriate file button (in the middle, with the green arrows) to assign them to the relevant category. Files and folders that have been added so far can be seen in the right-hand \u201cSelected Files\u201d view. When you are done selecting files, you can either click on \u201cFinish Selection\u201d or simply close the popup window, and the file selections will be noted in blue on the main input form. You can always mouse over this blue text to verify exactly which files have been assigned to that file category. Mapping Peak List and Result Files To satisfy the requirements of a \u201c complete \u201d dataset, the submission workflow will validate the files in the \u201cResult\u201d category to ensure that all spectrum identifications can be traced back to files in the \u201cPeak List\u201d category. However, it is not always clear to the software which files refer to which, so to clarify this an interface is provided to allow you to manually associate the files. Once you have selected all of your dataset\u2019s \u201cResult\u201d and \u201cPeak List\u201d files, then you can click on \u201cStart Associating Files\u201d to populate the mapper. The server may need a moment to search through all of your selected \u201cResult\u201d files, collecting all of the spectrum files that they reference, to populate the mapper interface. Once it\u2019s done, you will see a list of your selected \u201cPeak List\u201d files on the left, and all found spectrum file references from within your \u201cResult\u201d files on the right: The file references on the right are formatted to display the name of the result file, followed by a hash character (\u201c#\u201d), followed by the name of the spectrum file as specified within the result file. As you might imagine, the names of peak list files uploaded for submission might have changed since they were searched to produce this result file, or the result file may use a different path or file name syntax. This is why manual mapping is often necessary. You may find that if the file names match up in advance, then the mapper will pre-map the files according to the matched names. Things are usually easier when you\u2019re organized. To link up the file references with the peak list files that they correspond to, simply click on an associated pair, and then click \u201cAssociate Selected Files with Each Other\u201d. You can only map one pair of files at a time. As you add each mapping, the corresponding file reference on the right will disappear and the mapping will be added to the box at the bottom. As with metadata, you can remove an unwanted mapping by clicking the red \u201cX\u201d. Once all mappings are done, the mapper will indicate completion with a green check mark. Mapping these files is required for all \u201c complete \u201d datasets, which includes any dataset with at least one file in the \u201cResult\u201d category. If you submit files in this category, but do not complete the mapping in the submission form, then the submission will fail. Dataset Privacy All newly submitted MassIVE datasets are by default considered \u201cprivate\u201d. This means that, although technically anyone can view a dataset\u2019s basic details page (assuming they know the correct URL to that page), a private dataset will never show up in any public dataset search . Therefore, it is essentially impossible to find or view a private dataset without knowing its status page URL. This allows submitters to share their private datasets with specific people, such as colleagues or journal reviewers, while still preventing the general public from knowing about the dataset until the submitter is ready to make it public. The \u201cDataset Password\u201d field provides an optional extra layer of security. As long as the dataset remains private, this password must be provided to actually connect to the MassIVE FTP server and view or download the dataset\u2019s files. If no password is specified, then the dataset will still be considered private until the submitter decides to make it public, so there is little risk of unauthorized users finding it. The password feature is simply provided for extra security, at the submitter\u2019s discretion. Due to implementation requirements for controlled FTP access, even non-password protected datasets are technically given a password. However, all such datasets (including public ones) have the same default public password, which is simply the string \u201ca\u201d. Try entering this if you want to view a public dataset and you are being challenged by the server for password authentication. Once a dataset is submitted, its owner (the ProteoSAFe user who launched the submission workflow) can make it public at any time by clicking on the \u201cMake Public\u201d link near the top of the status page. Once a dataset is made public, its password is removed (or, more specifically, it is set to the public password \u201ca\u201d), and it then becomes visible in public dataset searches . Publication to ProteomeXchange If you check the \u201cSubmit to ProteomeXchange\u201d checkbox, then as soon as your dataset becomes public, a ProteomeXchange announcement message will automatically be generated and submitted for your dataset. When this happens, your dataset will show up in the list of publicly accessible datasets at ProteomeCentral . ProteomeXchange, as its name suggests, is a coordination service for the dissemination of proteomics datasets. If your dataset is does not fall within the domain of proteomics, then you probably don\u2019t want to announce it there. Even if you check this checkbox, a ProteomeXchange announcement message will not be generated until you actually click \u201cMake Public\u201d. Dataset Submission When you are ready to submit your dataset, click on the \u201cSubmit\u201d button at the bottom of the form, and your dataset will be sent to the MassIVE web server for validation. If any problems are found with your input, then you will be notified. Otherwise, you will see the job status page, which will be periodically updated with the current status of your dataset submission workflow. Blue boxes represent activities that have not yet started, orange boxes represent currently running activities, and green boxes represent activities that have completed successfully. The dataset submission workflow includes steps to process and validate the dataset files, record the details of the dataset in a database, and then securely copy the files to the MassIVE repository. If there is a problem in any step of the workflow, the job will fail and the relevant error messages will be displayed on the status page.","title":"Dataset Submission Workflow"},{"location":"submission_workflow/#dataset-metadata","text":"The first section of the submission form pertains to the dataset\u2019s metadata.

Each file submitted in the \u201cResult Files\u201d category contains at least 90% valid spectrum identifications. An identification is considered \u201cvalid\u201d if and only if it meets all of the following criteria: The identified spectrum can be found within one of the spectrum files submitted within the \u201cPeak List Files\u201d category described above. The peptide sequence and declared post-translational modifications for the identification can be found and reconstructed with no ambiguity. The MassIVE dataset submission workflow includes a file mapping interface , to ensure that submitted peak list files can be mapped to spectrum references from within the submitted result files. This is how MassIVE is able to find a spectrum in the source file, even if the result file uses a different filename to refer to that source.

This window will present you with a view of your MassIVE user account files, as well as an interface with which to assign these files to the various dataset categories. To add any of your uploaded files to the dataset, simply click individual files or whole folders in the left-hand folder view, and then click on the appropriate file button (in the middle, with the green arrows) to assign them to the relevant category. Files and folders that have been added so far can be seen in the right-hand \u201cSelected Files\u201d view. When you are done selecting files, you can either click on \u201cFinish Selection\u201d or simply close the popup window, and the file selections will be noted in blue on the main input form.

However, it is not always clear to the software which files refer to which, so to clarify this an interface is provided to allow you to manually associate the files. Once you have selected all of your dataset\u2019s \u201cResult\u201d and \u201cPeak List\u201d files, then you can click on \u201cStart Associating Files\u201d to populate the mapper. The server may need a moment to search through all of your selected \u201cResult\u201d files, collecting all of the spectrum files that they reference, to populate the mapper interface. Once it\u2019s done, you will see a list of your selected \u201cPeak List\u201d files on the left, and all found spectrum file references from within your \u201cResult\u201d files on the right: The file references on the right are formatted to display the name of the result file, followed by a hash character (\u201c#\u201d), followed by the name of the spectrum file as specified within the result file. As you might imagine, the names of peak list files uploaded for submission might have changed since they were searched to produce this result file, or the result file may use a different path or file name syntax. This is why manual mapping is often necessary. You may find that if the file names match up in advance, then the mapper will pre-map the files according to the matched names. Things are usually easier when you\u2019re organized. To link up the file references with the peak list files that they correspond to, simply click on an associated pair, and then click \u201cAssociate Selected Files with Each Other\u201d. You can only map one pair of files at a time. As you add each mapping, the corresponding file reference on the right will disappear and the mapping will be added to the box at the bottom. As with metadata, you can remove an unwanted mapping by clicking the red \u201cX\u201d. Once all mappings are done, the mapper will indicate completion with a green check mark. Mapping these files is required for all \u201c complete \u201d datasets, which includes any dataset with at least one file in the \u201cResult\u201d category.

This means that, although technically anyone can view a dataset\u2019s basic details page (assuming they know the correct URL to that page), a private dataset will never show up in any public dataset search . Therefore, it is essentially impossible to find or view a private dataset without knowing its status page URL. This allows submitters to share their private datasets with specific people, such as colleagues or journal reviewers, while still preventing the general public from knowing about the dataset until the submitter is ready to make it public. The \u201cDataset Password\u201d field provides an optional extra layer of security. As long as the dataset remains private, this password must be provided to actually connect to the MassIVE FTP server and view or download the dataset\u2019s files. If no password is specified, then the dataset will still be considered private until the submitter decides to make it public, so there is little risk of unauthorized users finding it. The password feature is simply provided for extra security, at the submitter\u2019s discretion. Due to implementation requirements for controlled FTP access, even non-password protected datasets are technically given a password. However, all such datasets (including public ones) have the same default public password, which is simply the string \u201ca\u201d. Try entering this if you want to view a public dataset and you are being challenged by the server for password authentication.

For instructions on how to register an account, see here . Once you have a MassIVE web site account, it is strongly recommended that you use FTP to upload your dataset files to your account, as opposed to the MassIVE web interface. This is because the web-based upload interface is optimized for quick uploads of small files, whereas for the much larger files typically associated with MassIVE datasets, FTP is much more stable and robust. To connect to your MassIVE user account via FTP, simply log on to the FTP server at massive.ucsd.edu, using the same username and password as your MassIVE web account. MassIVE FTP Server massive.ucsd.edu To do this, you will need to use your preferred FTP client program. There are many good free FTP clients, but a few of the more popular ones that have been tested with MassIVE include: WinSCP (recommended and used for the example illustrations below) CoreFTP CoffeeCup Free FTP Note: We no longer recommend FileZilla, since it was found to contain malware in a recent update. Most FTP client programs use a similar interface. There is usually some sort of server or session management interface, allowing you to set up and store your connection information for a particular FTP server, and then re-connect to that server easily. For example, in WinSCP: When setting up your FTP server connection, be sure to use plain FTP with no encryption. Then enter massive.ucsd.edu as the server or \u201chost\u201d name (port 21), followed by your MassIVE username and password, and the client should connect you to your user file space. From there, you can upload files by finding them on your computer (usually in the left panel) and then dragging them over to the server (usually in the right panel), or you can download files from the server to your computer by dragging them in the reverse direction. You can also experiment with the FTP client interface to move and rename files and folders on the server, so as to reorganize your uploaded data in whatever manner you prefer.

Please prepare each sheet as a separate file. Minimum required columns: !! Note : Column headers should be matched as below. Run : This column contains the identifier of a mass spectrometry run. Each mass spectrometry run should have a unique identifier, regardless of the origin of the biological sample. It could have Raw file names. Condition : This column indicates groups of interest (such as \u201cDisease\u201d or \u201cControl\u201d) or time points (such as \u201cT1\u201d, \u201cT2\u201d, etc). BioReplicate : This column should contain a unique identifier for each biological replicate in the experiment. For example, in a clinical proteomic investigation this should be a unique patient id. Patients from distinct groups should have distinct ids. If the technical replicates are present, all samples or runs from a same biological replicate should have a same id. Channel : This is only for iTRAQ or TMT experiment. This column contains labeling information (126, ... 131) for iTRAQ and TMT. It should be consistent with the channel columns in quantification. For MaxQuant output, the value of this column should have channel.0, channel.1, and so on. Addition columns for complex experimental design: Fraction : One technical replicate of one sample or TMT mixture may be fractionated into multiple fractions to increase the analytical depth. Then one technical replicate of one sample or TMT mixture should correspond to multiple fractions. TechReplicate : Technical replicate of one sample. One sample may have multiple technical replicates. For example, TechReplicate = 1 or 2 for the two technical replicates of one sample, then they should have the same Condition and BioReplicate values. TechRepMixture : Technical replicate of one TMT mixture. One mixture may have multiple technical replicates.

It could have Raw file names. Condition : This column indicates groups of interest (such as \u201cDisease\u201d or \u201cControl\u201d) or time points (such as \u201cT1\u201d, \u201cT2\u201d, etc). BioReplicate : This column should contain a unique identifier for each biological replicate in the experiment. For example, in a clinical proteomic investigation this should be a unique patient id. Patients from distinct groups should have distinct ids. If the technical replicates are present, all samples or runs from a same biological replicate should have a same id. Channel : This is only for iTRAQ or TMT experiment. This column contains labeling information (126, ... 131) for iTRAQ and TMT. It should be consistent with the channel columns in quantification. For MaxQuant output, the value of this column should have channel.0, channel.1, and so on. Addition columns for complex experimental design: Fraction : One technical replicate of one sample or TMT mixture may be fractionated into multiple fractions to increase the analytical depth. Then one technical replicate of one sample or TMT mixture should correspond to multiple fractions. TechReplicate : Technical replicate of one sample. One sample may have multiple technical replicates. For example, TechReplicate = 1 or 2 for the two technical replicates of one sample, then they should have the same Condition and BioReplicate values. TechRepMixture : Technical replicate of one TMT mixture. One mixture may have multiple technical replicates. For example, if TechRepMixture = 1, 2 are the two technical replicates of one mixture, then they should match with the same Mixture value. More information is welcome.

The MSstats workflow provides four options to select comparions. You should choose one of them. All vs. All : This option will generate all pairwise comparisons between conditions in the annotation file. If there are four conditions in the annotation files (Condition1, Condition2, Condition3, Condition4), a total of six pairwise comparisons will be considered in MSstats : Condition1-Condition2, Condition1-Condition3, Condition1-Condition4, Condition2-Condition3, Condition2-Condition4, Condition3-Condition4 . One vs. All : This option will generate all pairwise comparisons between one selected condition (base condition) and other conditions in the annotation file. You should select the base condition from the drop-down button, next to One vs. All option. If there are four conditions in the annotation files (Condition1, Condition2, Condition3, Condition4) and you select Condition1 for the base condition, total three pairwise comparisons will be considered in MSstats : Condition2-Condition1, Condition3-Condition1, Condition4-Condition1 . Choose Pairs : This option will allow you to select any pairwise comparison(s) you want. If you select Choose Pairs option, the list of conditions will be shown. Select one condition per each panel and then select the Add Selected Condition Pair button. Then the comparison(s) you selected will be shown in the box below. Contrast Matrix : If you want to compare the complex linear combination between conditions, you can make your contrast matrix and use it for MSstats.

If there are four conditions in the annotation files (Condition1, Condition2, Condition3, Condition4), a total of six pairwise comparisons will be considered in MSstats : Condition1-Condition2, Condition1-Condition3, Condition1-Condition4, Condition2-Condition3, Condition2-Condition4, Condition3-Condition4 . One vs. All : This option will generate all pairwise comparisons between one selected condition (base condition) and other conditions in the annotation file. You should select the base condition from the drop-down button, next to One vs. All option. If there are four conditions in the annotation files (Condition1, Condition2, Condition3, Condition4) and you select Condition1 for the base condition, total three pairwise comparisons will be considered in MSstats : Condition2-Condition1, Condition3-Condition1, Condition4-Condition1 . Choose Pairs : This option will allow you to select any pairwise comparison(s) you want. If you select Choose Pairs option, the list of conditions will be shown. Select one condition per each panel and then select the Add Selected Condition Pair button. Then the comparison(s) you selected will be shown in the box below. Contrast Matrix : If you want to compare the complex linear combination between conditions, you can make your contrast matrix and use it for MSstats. The table for the contrast matrix can be saved as a txt file. It should be uploaded in your account directory at MassIVE.","title":"2.3 Comparison Setup"},{"location":"quant-corona/3_msstats_workflow_2_run/#24-advanced-options","text":"There are advanced options for options available.
