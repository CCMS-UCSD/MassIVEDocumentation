Filtering and Sorting Datasets On the datasets page, you will see a list of all current public datasets in the repository. This list is sorted by default in decreasing order of upload date (most recent first). You can page through the list using the controls at the top, and you can also sort and filter by any column using the controls in the column headers. To filter, simply enter your search term in the box at the top of the relevant column, and then click \u201cFilter\u201d; multiple filters can be combined in this manner. Alternatively, you can select specific datasets by checking the boxes next to them, then check the \u201cchecked only\u201d box, and then hit \u201cFilter\u201d, to reduce the list to only those rows that you want to see. When you are ready to view the details of a particular dataset, just click on its green \u201cMassIVE ID\u201d link to load the status page for that dataset. Viewing a Dataset Once a dataset has been successfully submitted, its status page will update to a dataset details view. This page will show the dataset\u2019s relevant metadata, as well as links to browse and download the actual dataset files themselves. This page is usually reached from a MassIVE public dataset search , although it can technically be viewed by anyone with a direct link to its URL. In fact, if a dataset is still private, then direct linking is the only way to view it, since private datasets will never show up in public searches. In this way, private datasets can still be shared with relevant users (such as publication reviewers), while still maintaining reasonable privacy from the general public. See here for more information about dataset privacy. Reviewer Access If your dataset is private, and you wish to share it with colleagues such as journal reviewers, simply provide the dataset\u2019s reviewer account login credentials. See here for more information. Dataset FTP Access To view or download a dataset\u2019s files, simply click on the \u201cFTP Download\u201d link on this page. If you are asked to enter a username and password, then use the dataset ID and password as shown here: Once you are connected to the dataset\u2019s FTP directory, then the browser will bring up a listing of the dataset\u2019s top-level directory, which can be navigated just like any directory listing. Alternatively, you can simply copy the FTP URL and then paste it into your preferred FTP client program, which will then (after any relevant password authentication) provide the same access to the dataset\u2019s files. Dataset Passwords Technically, you must enter a password to access any dataset\u2019s files by FTP. If the dataset is public, or is private but the submitter did not specify a password, then it should be accessible using the anonymous password \u201ca\u201d. Try entering \u201ca\u201d as the dataset\u2019s password if you want to view a public dataset and you are being challenged by the server for password authentication. Browsing Submitted Result Files If a dataset is considered \u201ccomplete\u201c , then its result files (spectrum identifications, peptides, proteins, etc.) are provided in a standardized format that MassIVE can parse and summarize for you. To browse these results, start by clicking on the \u201cBrowse Submitted Result Files\u201d link on the dataset\u2019s status page. This will present a tabular summary of the dataset\u2019s various result files. Here you can see how many rows of each type were found in (or derived from) each submitted result file, with the numbers also serving as links to the parsed results of that type. Click on a link to view the results of the desired type, then all the usual features of ProteoSAFe tabular result views are available \u2013 filtering, sorting, showing/hiding columns, etc. For each row displaying a spectrum identification, you can click on the small spectrum image icon on the left to see an annotated visualization of it.","title":"Access Public Datasets"},{"location":"access_public_datasets/#filtering-and-sorting-datasets","text":"On the datasets page, you will see a list of all current public datasets in the repository.

There are two ways to do this: Attach results from a completed ProteoSAFe analysis workflow. Upload your own results from a search tool run offline. Attach ProteoSAFe Reanalysis Results If you reanalyzed a MassIVE dataset's spectrum files using a ProteoSAFe workflow , then once that workflow has finished you can attach its results to the original dataset by clicking the \"Attach Reanalysis Results to Dataset\" link on the job's status page: This brings you to the MassIVE reanalysis attachment workflow input form, with your analysis task's result files pre-selected: In this case, MassIVE will do the work of determining which dataset(s) to attach your results to, based on the source spectrum data of your analysis job. Since you ran your ProteoSAFe analysis workflow on spectra from a MassIVE dataset, the system will automatically trace that connection back to find the proper home for your reanalysis. If you attempt to do this with an analysis job that was not run on dataset spectra, then the system will let you know with an error message. Upload Offline Reanalysis Results If you reanalyzed a MassIVE dataset's spectrum files using offline analysis tools, then you can still attach those results to the proper dataset. Start by uploading your result files to your MassIVE account. Then navigate to the dataset's web page and click the \"Add Reanalysis\" button: This brings you to a blank MassIVE reanalysis attachment workflow input form. From here, you can select all the files for your reanalysis by clicking any of the \"Select Input Files\" buttons: From the file selection pop-up window, browse your account to select the result files you uploaded, as well as any other files you wish to attach for this reanalysis. Then determine the dataset to attach to by selecting the spectrum files from that dataset that you searched in your offline analysis. You should find that the proper dataset is automatically imported to your account from when you clicked \"Add Reanalysis\" back on the dataset page. Submit Reanalysis Attachment Once you've selected valid reanalysis files and spectrum files from a public MassIVE dataset, fully configure and submit the rest of your reanalysis attachment job (including mapping your result files to the dataset's peak list files ). The reanalysis attachment workflow will determine which source datasets were reanalyzed, and will then prepare what's referred to as a \"reanalysis container\" for your attachment. A reanalysis container simply refers to the unique set of datasets that were reanalyzed - usually only one, but possibly more. The workflow then attaches your results to this container. Any other reanalysis results attached (by any user) to this same set of datasets will also go in the same container. Once the attachment job is finished, both the container and the reanalysis will now show up on the dataset page: As well as on the page for the container itself (which is always accessible from the dataset): Each individual reanalysis has its own page, as well (accessible from either the dataset or the container): And the reanalysis files will be available for download from the container's FTP space: Finally, you can browse the spectrum identification results for your reanalysis by clicking on \"Browse Results\" from the reanalysis page, and from there you can trace all the way back to the source ProteoSAFe task that produced each result file, if that's how you generated your results:","title":"Share Reanalyses"},{"location":"share_reanalyses/#attach-proteosafe-reanalysis-results","text":"If you reanalyzed a MassIVE dataset's spectrum files using a ProteoSAFe workflow , then once that workflow has finished you can attach its results to the original dataset by clicking the \"Attach Reanalysis Results to Dataset\" link on the job's status page: This brings you to the MassIVE reanalysis attachment workflow input form, with your analysis task's result files pre-selected: In this case, MassIVE will do the work of determining which dataset(s) to attach your results to, based on the source spectrum data of your analysis job.

Run the MassIVE dataset submission workflow on those files. 1 - Upload Data to MassIVE Register MassIVE Account MassIVE dataset submission is only available to registered users \u2013 anonymous submissions are not supported. See here for detailed instructions on how to register an account. Upload Data to Your Account Start by uploading your data files to your private MassIVE account. Doing this will not create an official dataset in the MassIVE repository. Your files will remain private in your account\u2019s FTP directory until you are ready to submit them to the MassIVE repository in step 2. FTP File Upload Once you have a MassIVE web site account, you can upload files to your account easily using FTP. See here for detailed instructions on how to do this. Dataset File Organization See here for a detailed explanation of the various file categories within a MassIVE dataset submission. A recommended procedure for simplifying the MassIVE submission process is to use FTP to upload and organize your files into separate folders, each named for one of the dataset\u2019s main file categories. This way, when you are ready to make your submission, all you need to do is select each folder and assign it to its proper category, without having to fumble through a large number of individual file assignments. 2 - Submit Data to MassIVE Run Submission Workflow Once your files are fully uploaded to your user account directory at MassIVE, you must then run the dataset submission workflow on those files in order to create an official dataset in the MassIVE repository. See here for detailed instructions on how to set up and run this workflow. After Submission Once a dataset is successfully submitted, it will become a private dataset in the MassIVE repository.
