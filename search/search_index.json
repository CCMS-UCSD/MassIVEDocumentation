The public availability of mass spectrometry data is increasingly recognized as indispensable for the future of computational mass spectrometry and, consequently, for the collective ability of the proteomics community to progress towards efficiently reutilizing the billions of spectra already acquired and the many millions more being generated on a daily basis. But despite the pioneering efforts of the Tranche/ProteomeCommons system and the essential integration services under development by the ProteomeXchange consortium, there is still a pressing need for data repositories designed not only for reliable sharing of primary data but also offering user-friendly tools for advanced data analysis and visualization. MassIVE is a new mass spectrometry data repository designed to store, browse, redistribute, re-analyze and integrate all publicly available mass spectrometry data. Since its inception, MassIVE has imported multiple Terabytes of mass spectrometry data in over 6,000 datasets from the now-extinct Tranche repository which are now available as MassIVE datasets and can be searched using the original Tranche hash strings. In addition, new datasets submissions to MassIVE already more than doubled the volume of data recovered from Tranche and continue to increase the volume and diversity of mass spectrometry data available to the proteomics community.","title":"MassIVE Introduction"},{"location":"#massive-documentation","text":"MassIVE is a worldwide mass spectrometry data repository integrated into a flexible, scalable, user-friendly framework offering a diverse set of data analysis algorithms.

Run the MassIVE dataset submission workflow on those files. 1 \u2013 Upload Data to MassIVE Register MassIVE Account MassIVE dataset submission is only available to registered users \u2013 anonymous submissions are not supported. See here for detailed instructions on how to register an account. Upload Data to Your Account Start by uploading your data files to your private MassIVE account. Doing this will not create an official dataset in the MassIVE repository. Your files will remain private in your account\u2019s FTP directory until you are ready to submit them to the MassIVE repository in step 2. FTP File Upload Once you have a MassIVE web site account, you can upload files to your account easily using FTP. See here for detailed instructions on how to do this. Dataset File Organization See here for a detailed explanation of the various file categories within a MassIVE dataset submission. A recommended procedure for simplifying the MassIVE submission process is to use FTP to upload and organize your files into separate folders, each named for one of the dataset\u2019s main file categories. This way, when you are ready to make your submission, all you need to do is select each folder and assign it to its proper category, without having to fumble through a large number of individual file assignments. 2 \u2013 Submit Data to MassIVE Run Submission Workflow Once your files are fully uploaded to your user account directory at MassIVE, you must then run the dataset submission workflow on those files in order to create an official dataset in the MassIVE repository. See here for detailed instructions on how to set up and run this workflow. After Submission Once a dataset is successfully submitted, it will become a private dataset in the MassIVE repository. Authorized users (those who have been given the dataset\u2019s status page URL and password) will be able to view the dataset in the MassIVE web interface, but it will not show up in any public dataset searches . At that point, a few more options become available to further manage the dataset: Reviewer Access See here for detailed instructions on how to share your private dataset with journal reviewers and other trusted colleagues. Make Public See here for detailed instructions on how to make a private dataset public. Add/Update Metadata See here for detailed instructions on how to add or update the metadata associated with an existing dataset. Add Publication See here for detailed instructions on how to update the set of publications associated with an existing dataset.","title":"CCMS submit data"},{"location":"reanalyze_spectra/","text":"Start reanalyzing MassIVE datasets by clicking the \u201cReanalyze Spectra\u201d button on the dataset page: This brings you to the ProteoSAFe data analysis workflow input form, with the dataset\u2019s spectrum files pre-selected.

There are two ways to do this: Attach results from a completed ProteoSAFe analysis workflow. Upload your own results from a search tool run offline. 1 - Attach ProteoSAFe Reanalysis Results If you reanalyzed a MassIVE dataset's spectrum files using a ProteoSAFe workflow , then once that workflow has finished you can attach its results to the original dataset by clicking the \"Attach Reanalysis Results to Dataset\" link on the job's status page: This brings you to the MassIVE reanalysis attachment workflow input form, with your analysis task's result files pre-selected: In this case, MassIVE will do the work of determining which dataset(s) to attach your results to, based on the source spectrum data of your analysis job. Since you ran your ProteoSAFe analysis workflow on spectra from a MassIVE dataset, the system will automatically trace that connection back to find the proper home for your reanalysis. If you attempt to do this with an analysis job that was not run on dataset spectra, then the system will let you know with an error message. 2 - Upload Offline Reanalysis Results If you reanalyzed a MassIVE dataset's spectrum files using offline analysis tools, then you can still attach those results to the proper dataset. Start by uploading your result files to your MassIVE account. Then navigate to the dataset's web page and click the \"Add Reanalysis\" button: This brings you to a blank MassIVE reanalysis attachment workflow input form. From here, you can select all the files for your reanalysis by clicking any of the \"Select Input Files\" buttons: From the file selection pop-up window, browse your account to select the result files you uploaded, as well as any other files you wish to attach for this reanalysis. Then determine the dataset to attach to by selecting the spectrum files from that dataset that you searched in your offline analysis. You should find that the proper dataset is automatically imported to your account from when you clicked \"Add Reanalysis\" back on the dataset page. Submit Reanalysis Attachment Once you've selected valid reanalysis files and spectrum files from a public MassIVE dataset, fully configure and submit the rest of your reanalysis attachment job (including mapping your result files to the dataset's peak list files ). The reanalysis attachment workflow will determine which source datasets were reanalyzed, and will then prepare what's referred to as a \"reanalysis container\" for your attachment. A reanalysis container simply refers to the unique set of datasets that were reanalyzed - usually only one, but possibly more. The workflow then attaches your results to this container. Any other reanalysis results attached (by any user) to this same set of datasets will also go in the same container. Once the attachment job is finished, both the container and the reanalysis will now show up on the dataset page: As well as on the page for the container itself (which is always accessible from the dataset): Each individual reanalysis has its own page, as well (accessible from either the dataset or the container): And the reanalysis files will be available for download from the container's FTP space: Finally, you can browse the spectrum identification results for your reanalysis by clicking on \"Browse Results\" from the reanalysis page, and from there you can trace all the way back to the source ProteoSAFe task that produced each result file, if that's how you generated your results:","title":"Share Reanalyses"}]}
