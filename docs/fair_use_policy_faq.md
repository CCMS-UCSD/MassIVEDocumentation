### MassIVE/GNPS Fair Use Policy - Frequently Asked Questions
1. **I thought MassIVE storage was permanent - does this mean the dataset accession mentioned in my manuscript might be deleted?**

    No - this policy only affects private user storage, i.e. the files that you upload directly to your MassIVE/GNPS account. Any files that you have already submitted to a MassIVE dataset or reanalysis, whether public or temporarily private (as is common while manuscripts are under review), do NOT count toward your account's storage quota and are NOT affected by this policy.

2. **How do I reduce my storage to comply with the policy?**

    You can easily reduce your private storage space using any of the following methods:

    - Submit your files to MassIVE (see documentation [here](submission_workflow.md)).
    - Use the "User Files" option on the website banner to view, sort and delete files/folders (see documentation [here](user_file_management.md)).
    - Use an FTP client, as is commonly used for large data transfers (see documentation [here](upload_data.md)).
    - Contact us at [ccms@proteomics.ucsd.edu](mailto:ccms@proteomics.ucsd.edu) if you feel that none of these options are suitable for your needs.

3. **I need to store my files for longer than 4 months. How can I do that?**

    If your circumstances are unique and you anticipate it will take longer than 4 months to prepare for an upcoming dataset submission, and you cannot store your files elsewhere, then please contact us at [ccms@proteomics.ucsd.edu](mailto:ccms@proteomics.ucsd.edu) and we will be happy to help find a suitable solution.

4. **I've reduced my storage to under 100 GB, but my account is still flagged as "Non-compliant". What do I do?**

    Simply log in to either the MassIVE or GNPS web portal, and you should see a button on the main portal page that you can click to verify that your account is now compliant. The system will then check your account and automatically update its status. This may take some time, since the system will check all the files in your account.

5. **I followed the recommended steps to reduce my storage, but I'm still having problems. What do I do?**

    Please contact us at [ccms@proteomics.ucsd.edu](mailto:ccms@proteomics.ucsd.edu) and we will be happy to help you resolve any problems you might have.
