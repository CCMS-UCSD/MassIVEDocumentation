After you've successfully reanalyzed **public data** from MassIVE, share your findings with the community by attaching your results (**quantification and statistical analysis result**) back to the dataset.

If you reanalyzed a MassIVE dataset's spectrum files and their quantification **using offline analysis tools** (such as Skyline, MaxQuant, Proteome Discoverer, Spectronaut, etc for data processing and R packages, Perseus, etc for statistical analysis), then you can attach those results to the proper dataset, as an **reanalysis**.

**Note: If submit new datasets, check [submit new dataset to MassIVE](https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/MassIVEDocumentation/submit_data/) and follow this documentation for submitting quantification and statistical analysis result.**

There are two steps to submit your reanalysis to the datasets.

1. Upload your data files to the MassIVE web server.
2. Run *Add Reanalysis* workflow on those files.
