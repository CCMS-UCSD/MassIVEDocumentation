You can filter the rows. Let's check the rows for 'Condition1'.

1. Type 'Condition1' in the empty box in the first row and below the column name, 'Condition'.
2. Click `Filter` button at the top left of table.

Then, the rows with 'Condition1' for `Condition` column are shown. For this example, there are three raw files from 'Condition1'.
