To represent quantification and extract meaningful insight there are two file formats that we define:

 1. Minimal Feature Input Format (MFIF) - This describes feature quantification
 1. Annotation Format - This describes the experimental design and conditions to meaningfully compare

These two files are used for creating a reanalysis for MassIVE.quant as well as enabling you to compute statistics with the MSstats workflow. 

 ## MFIF Documentation

This describes the quantification format that will be required. The format must be tab separated.

| Header | Description | Required |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Protein | Name of the protein | Proteomics |
| Unmodified Peptide | Sequence of peptide without modifications | Proteomics |
| Modified Peptide | Sequence of peptide including modifications | Proteomics |
| Compound | Name of the compound | Metabolomics |
| Feature ID | Feature ID | Metabolomics |
| m/z | Mass to charge ratio | All | 
| Charge | Precursor charge | All | 
| Run | Sample/Run Name | All | 
| Intensity | Intensity for the feature | All |
