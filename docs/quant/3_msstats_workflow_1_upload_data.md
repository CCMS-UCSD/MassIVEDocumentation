Before you run **MSstats workflow**, quantification files(reports) from data processing tools should be ready. 

### 1.1 Option1: Use Published Quant
If you know MSV ID or RMSV ID including quantification files, you can import them in the **MSstats workflow**.

You are ready to move on to **Step 2: MSstats workflow**.

### 1.2 Option2: Upload New Quant
If you have new quantification files, start by uploading your quantification files to your MassIVE account.

Uploading data for MassIVE repository submission is the general procedure for any data submittion in MassIVE repository.
Please follow the instruction on [how to upload data for MassIVE repository](https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/MassIVEDocumentation/submit_data/).

Then, move on to **Step 2: MSstats workflow**.
