**MassIVE.quant** is an extension of the Mass Spectrometry Interactive Virtual Environment (MassIVE) to provide the opportunity for large-scale deposition of heterogeneous experimental datasets, and facilitate a community-wide conversation about the necessary extent of experiment documentation and the benefits of its use. MassIVE.quant supports various reproducibility scopes, such as the infrastructure to fully automate the workflow, to store, and to browse the intermediate results. In addition, MassIVE.quant provides a collection of consistently documented and analyzed benchmark datasets.
