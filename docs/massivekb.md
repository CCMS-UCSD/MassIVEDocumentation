The MassIVE Knowledge Base (MassIVE-KB) is a set of peptide spectral libraries. They are distilled from 31TB of human proteomics HCD data. Users can peak at the inside of these libraries, browse the source data, and track full provenance of analysis tasks that created these libraries. 


## Browsing Libraries

You can browser MassIVE-KB libraries to explore what is in them, and what is the provenance. 

## Using Libraries

These spectral libraries can be:

1. Downloaded as MGF in external programs (e.g. MSPLIT)
1. Downloaded as MSP/SPTXT in external programs (e.g. SpectraST)
1. Downloaded as JSON
1. Searched in MassIVE (e.g. Maestro, MSPLIT)

## Creating Your Own

You can create your own spectral libraries with our MassIVE-KB pipelines.
