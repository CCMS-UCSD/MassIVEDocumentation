# Make Public


Any time after a dataset is submitted, the submitter can choose to make it public by clicking the "Make Public" link near the top of the dataset page.

![MassIVE_make_public](img/make_public/MassIVE_make_public.png)

When this happens, the dataset is affected in the following ways:

*   It appears in [public dataset searches](access_public_datasets.md) on the MassIVE web site.
*   The dataset's private [password](submission_workflow.md#dataset-privacy) is removed, and the dataset becomes available to download via [anonymous (public) FTP](download_data.md).
*   If the submitter checked the "[Submit to ProteomeXchange](submission_workflow.md#publication-to-proteomexchange)" checkbox, then a ProteomeXchange announcement message is submitted, and the dataset will appear in the list of public datasets at [ProteomeCentral](http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset).

NOTE: MassIVE will make a dataset public on the submitter's behalf if a paper is published that includes the dataset accession and a member of the community requests that the specific accession be made public.
