    <h3 id="massivegnps-fair-use-policy">MassIVE/GNPS Fair Use Policy</h3>
<p>For 10 years MassIVE and GNPS have provided valuable storage data analysis and repository services to the proteomics, metabolomics and natural products research communities, and we remain committed to providing a high quality service to the research community around the world. Since its inception, MassIVE and GNPS have provided free storage of mass spectrometry data to allow users to share their data via public dataset submissions, as well as to run any of our many freely available data analysis workflows. Many thousands of users thus continue to productively use our system in a manner that requires only limited long-term storage for files that are not used for dataset submissions.</p>
<p>Within the MassIVE/GNPS ecosystem, data is stored in two main locations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each user account’s temporary private file space</li>
<li>Datasets a user has submitted to the public MassIVE repository</li>
</ul>
<p>The storage policy for submitted MassIVE datasets remains as it always has. Any dataset submitted to MassIVE will be permanently stored, with no limit to the amount of space occupied by any single user’s submissions, as long as each dataset is made public in a timely manner (shortly after publication of any associated manuscript). Making data and knowledge public benefits all users, and we want to ensure that all submissions contribute to the MassIVE/GNPS ecosystem’s capabilities.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to user account private file space, we have identified a growing number of users exceeding the average user’s storage volume by several orders of magnitude. These are private user files that have never been used in a MassIVE dataset submission, and therefore do not contribute to the overall public knowledge ecosystem and are using up large quantities of data infrastructure that could be better leveraged to enhance public knowledge.</p>
<p>Consequently, <strong><ins>it has become necessary to require that all users limit their long-term (&gt;=6 months) private user account storage to 100 GB or less, and that accounts remain active during the last 12 month period</ins></strong>.</p>
<p>Files being prepared for dataset submissions or used in data analysis workflows will still be able to temporarily use over 100 GB of storage, as is often required for submission of large datasets. We simply ask that you avoid keeping your account’s total storage above 100 GB for several months on end.</p>
<p>If the total volume of user account uploads exceeds 100 GB for more than 4 months or the user account has been inactive for more than 12 months, then the account will be flagged as  "Non-compliant" and the following restrictions will apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user account will no longer be able to launch new jobs other than dataset submissions (see documentation <a href="../submission_workflow/">here</a>).</li>
<li>Non-compliant accounts will be able to reduce their storage use below the 100 GB limit using either of the following two methods:<ul>
<li>Using the "User Files" option on the website banner to see, sort and delete files/folders (see documentation <a href="../user_file_management/">here</a>)</li>
<li>Using an FTP client, as is commonly used for large data transfers (see documentation <a href="../upload_data/">here</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New files uploaded while the account is Non-compliant will not be retained in the system</li>
<li>If an account remains non-compliant for longer than 2 months (6 months total in non-compliant status), then<ul>
<li>Old files uploaded &gt;12 months ago to inactive user accounts that have not accessed the system in the last 12 months will be automatically deleted.</li>
<li>If still necessary after deletion of old files, the total storage volume will be further reduced by automatically deleting the oldest files until the total storage space is reduced to no more than 100 GB.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><ins>Current accounts that have already exceeded 200 GB of storage since August 1st 2021 will be immediately marked as Non-compliant</ins></strong> and <strong><ins>will need to reduce their total storage to 100 GB or less by November 1st to avoid automated deletion of the account’s oldest files</ins></strong>.</p>
<p>We understand that this updated policy will require adjustments from some of our users and we will do all we can to minimize the impact of these changes while continuing to provide high quality services to all MassIVE and GNPS users. In particular, we understand that these requirements may cause some dataset files to have to be uploaded more than once before the full dataset can be submitted. To reduce the chances of requiring multiple uploads, we recommend that (a) all dataset files be uploaded only when the dataset is essentially ready for submission within just a few months or (b) data for a manuscript can also be submitted as multiple smaller datasets, all of which can then be associated with the same papers or project grants.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about this policy, please consult our <a href="../fair_use_policy_faq/">Fair Use Policy FAQ</a> or contact us at <a href="mailto:ccms@proteomics.ucsd.edu">ccms@proteomics.ucsd.edu</a>.</p>
